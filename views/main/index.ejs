    <h1>What is Bobtail Method?</h1>

    <p>
      Most songs today are written by layering the melody atop a looped harmonic progression. There's nothing wrong with this approach. However:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>It's awfully commonplace.</li>
      <li>The melody can sound arbitrary, or conceived as an afterthought.</li>
      <li>The classics of the past were obviously not written this way.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Bobtail Method teaches today's aspiring songwriters to write songs the classic way. That is to say, melody and harmony are written <em>simultaneously</em>, each informing the other in equal measures.
