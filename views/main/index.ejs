    <h1>Bobtail Method</h1>

    <p>
      Most songs today are written by layering the melody atop a looped harmonic progression. There's nothing bad or wrong about this approach. However:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>It's awfully commonplace.</li>
      <li>The melody can sound arbitrary, or conceived as an afterthought.</li>
      <li>When listening to the standards, it becomes obvious that traditional songwriting involved a far different approach.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Bobtail Method teaches today's aspiring songwriters to write songs like those of the past. Melody and harmony are written simultaneously, each informing the other in equal measures.
