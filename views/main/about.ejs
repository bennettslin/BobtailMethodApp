    <h1>Get Started with the Bobtail Method</h1>

    <p>
      It's easy! We start with a three-bar staff in 6/8 meter. Across the first barline, the harmony will inform the melody, and across the second, vice versa. Now:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Pick chords for the first two bars.</li>
      <li>Write a melody underneath those chords.</li>
      <li>Extend the melody into the third bar.</li>
      <li>Choose a chord for the third bar.</li>
      <li>Revise, polish, and finish.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That's it! You now have motivic material by which to flesh out your composition!</p>
