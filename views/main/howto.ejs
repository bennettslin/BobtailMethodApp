    <h1>Quick Guide</h1>
    <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
    <p>
      We start with a three-bar staff in 6/8 meter. Across the first barline, the harmony informs the melody, while across the second barline, the melody informs the harmony.

    <p>That's it! You now have thematic material by which to flesh out your composition.</p>
    <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>

    <p>
      While there are no hard and fast rules, interesting melodies typically share similar traits, so here are some useful tips to keep in mind.
    </p>

    <ul>
    <% for (var i = 5; i < 12; i++) { %>
      <% if (i == 6 || i == 9) { %>
        <%= instructionArray[i] %>
      <% } else { %>
      <li><%= instructionArray[i] %></li>
      <% } %>

      <div class="abc" id="<%= i %>">
X:<%= i %>
M:none
L:1/8
K:<%= keyArray[i - 5] %>
<%= abcArray[i] %>
      </div>
      <button class="playback-button btn btn-primary play"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></i></button>
    <% } %>
    </ul>
